# AI Business Insight Generator

## Overview
This project is an **AI-powered business intelligence dashboard** built with **Python, SQL, and Streamlit**.  
It simulates real-world business data using synthetic generation (via Faker), automates ETL workflows, and provides key performance insights through dynamic visualizations and an AI-generated executive summary.

The goal was to replicate an end-to-end data analytics process — from **data extraction to business insight generation** — to demonstrate skills in data engineering, analytics, and automation.

---

## Features
- **ETL Pipeline**: Automated data generation, cleaning, and transformation using Python (Pandas, Faker).  
- **AI-Powered Summary**: NLP-based text generation summarizing key insights.  
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Streamlit interface showing KPIs, regional performance tables, and charts.  
- **Data Storage**: Output stored as CSV files for reproducibility and SQL integration.  
- **Scalable Design**: Can be extended to real business datasets or APIs.

## Tech Stack
| Category | Tools & Libraries |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Programming | Python |
| Data | Pandas, SQL |
| Visualization | Streamlit |
| AI / NLP | OpenAI (or placeholder) |
| Automation | Faker |
| Reporting | CSV, Power BI (optional extension) |

## How It Works
1. **Data Generation** – Faker library creates synthetic sales and performance data.  
2. **ETL Pipeline** – Data is cleaned, merged, and aggregated using Pandas.  
3. **AI Summary** – A short executive summary is generated from KPIs.  
4. **Dashboard Visualization** – Streamlit displays KPIs, charts, and summaries interactively.
